I realize I haven't updated this site in a while -- mostly due to lack
of time. The past two weeks have been pretty busy (read: I now actually
have work to do), which also means I have very little time to devote to
personal projects. Anyway, on with the update.

## I now work at CometChat

I've begun working as an Engineering Intern at
[CometChat](https://www.cometchat.com). It's been a very interesting
experience so far. Most of my work revolves around infrastructure and
platform engineering -- pretty exciting stuff. [Oops, redacted]


I have also been extensively dabbling in XMPP and websocket internals,
as I'm writing a websocket proxy of sorts. I'll probably talk about it
in a future blog post, once I get approval org-side. :^)

## that's literally it

I sat all day thinking of what else to add to this post -- there's _got
to be_ something else right? Not really. I don't think I did anything
worthwhile. I did get some pretty interesting emails from people who
read this blog, so yes, please email me -- even if it's just to say hi.
I always reply.
