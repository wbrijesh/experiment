This is a shill post. I'm launching my new side-project:
https://forlater.email. It's an email-based bookmarking service -- you
send an email to `save@forlater.email`, get a readable, clutter-free
version of it back.

I'll write a more technical post on how I built it; this weekend
perhaps. Until then, go try it!
