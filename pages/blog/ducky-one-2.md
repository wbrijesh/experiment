Thanks to the pandemic yada yada I've been working from home (and
attending college from home), and I figured my WFH setup could use an
upgrade. Unfortunately, the choices for mechanical keyboards in India are
fairly limited. All imports from China don't get through, and imports
from elsewhere have a _fat_ duty slapped on it -- sometimes up to
300%[^1]. It's obscene!

The only reliable source I've found (and folks on
[r/mkindia](https://reddit.com/r/mkindia) will concur), is
[Meckeys](https://meckeys.com). They aren't particularly abundant in
variety, but there's some decent prebuilts that you can pick up on
there -- and I copped the Ducky One 2 SF.

It's a 65% board, so unlike standard 60% boards, this comes with arrow
keys and the `Del`, `PgUp` and `PgDn` keys. I don't _really_ need the
arrow keys, but they do come handy on the occasion -- like scrolling,
for example. Since this board lacks the function row, the `Esc` and the
`~` keys are merged. I have to hit `Shift + Esc` for tilde (same action
as usual), and `Fn + Esc` for the backtick. Takes a bit of relearning,
but it's manageable.

The key switches I went with were the Cherry MX Speed Silvers -- like
Reds but actuate a bit faster. As it's my first ever mechanical
keyboard, I don't really have anything to compare it against. It feels
_great_, but it was pretty jarring initially because even the slightest
touch (with the palm for instance), would cause a key to actuate, leading
to typos. Again, just a matter of getting accustomed to it; all smooth
sailing after. Why did I pick the Speed Silvers? The other switch
options were out of stock.

That said, I think I really quite like linear switches. They're not
_too_ noisy, and they feel just right. I haven't noticed any great
improvement in my typing speeds though -- I still maintain an average of
90-100 WPM.

The One 2 SF is fully RGB, i.e. each key is individually lit. Not that
I make big use it. I have it set to plain white, and only light up under
the key I'm currently pressing. Yes, this also makes it incredibly easy
for people to shoulder-peek your passwords. I certainly won't be using
it outside home.

The keyboard itself cost 9599 INR, which is about 128 USD. Meckeys
took exactly 10 days to ship it (3rd Aug - 13th Aug). Overall, it's
a lovely keyboard, and I _cannot_ type on my laptop's low-travel
chiclet-style keyboard, again. There's just no going back.
