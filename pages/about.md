I'm Anirudh Oppiliappan, often found as **icyphox** (or sometimes just
**icy**) on the Internet. I currently live in beautiful Helsinki,
Finland and work for [UpCloud](https://upcloud.com) as a Kubernetes
Engineer. Below are a few things that interest me, and can serve as
conversation starters for you:

- Security. All kinds of it: operational, physical, threat intel,
  cloud-native, etc.
- Infrastructure. Kubernetes, containers, observability.
- Geopolitics and national security; mostly eastern Europe and Russia.
- Motorsport. I closely follow F1, F2 and F3.
- Startups and indie-hacking. Admittedly, I don't know much but I follow
  the space.
- Fitness. Strength training, calisthenics.
- The Go programming language. I love Go and I swear by the standard
  library.
- (Spoken) language learning. Currently learning Finnish. Big
  fan of total immersion and comprehensible input.
- Self-hosting and homelabbing.
- Ergonomic keyboards. I like to build them. I also like to use them.
- Electric skateboarding and PEVs.
- 35mm film photography.
