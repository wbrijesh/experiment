This site is built using [vite](https://git.icyphox.sh/vite) -- a static
site generator written in Go. The wiki index is generated using a [shell
script](https://git.icyphox.sh/site/tree/bin/wiki.sh), with heavy use of
bashisms. This script runs prior to vite, and preps the wiki index
page's markdown.

The blog is used as a space for my rants, long form writing and
descriptions of my technical endeavours. This wiki is my personal
logging system; a map of my mind. It is a work in progress, and is far
from done, as of this writing.

Nearly all media content, barring some old images, are served from my
file host at https://x.icyphox.sh. This is hosted on my Raspberry Pi, at
home. If you notice slow image loads, this is why. At present, I have no
plans to change this setup.
