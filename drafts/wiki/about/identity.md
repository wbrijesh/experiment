![the motif](/static/white.svg)

There isn't much behind **icyphox**. A common explaination I like to
give: I like the color of ice, and I like foxes; "icyfox" was taken, so
"icyphox" was the next best thing.

I used to use shades of cyan (`#00ffff`) along with a cyanish black
(`#021012`) in the past. You may have noticed this if you had visited
this site a few years ago. My color choices have since mellowed down --
or perhaps, I have matured. I stick to shades of black and gray for
foregrounds, and a plain white background.

The fonts are set to `serif`, in this site's CSS. You are viewing your
local system's serif font.

There were many iterations of the motif, but I finally settled down on
the monochrome, silhouette-esque one. Naturallly, the motif draws
inspiration from the fox.
