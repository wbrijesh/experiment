cwm(1) is -- hands down -- the best window manager that I have used. And
I have used many. It ships with very sane defaults, and
configuration is a breeze.

It has a built-in launcher, workspaces (called groups), and a few more
neat features. My `.cwmrc` is available
[here](https://git.icyphox.sh/dotfiles/tree/home/.cwmrc).
