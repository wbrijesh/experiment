![the HP Envy 13](https://x.icyphox.sh/iyvxg.jpg)

The HP Envy 13 has been my personal computer for what will be its 4th
year now. It sports an i5 8250u, 8 gigs of RAM, a 256GB SSD and a
comfortable 13.3" FHD screen. It's light and portable.

Arguably, the best part about this device is its compatibility with
Linux and OpenBSD. Literally everything works out-of-the-box. It shares
very similar specs with the XPS 13, which might explain it.

Stickers of note:

- GPL and GNU (top left): Got them at a talk RMS was giving at RVCE,
    Bangalore. 
- RUN BSD (top right): A kind OpenBSD user on Twitter shipped them over
    to me, free of charge, from the Netherlands. 
- Tor (top middle and right): Got them from Tor project member
    [@kushaldas](https://toots.dgplug.org/@kushal).
- r00t (all over): Some Twitter giveaway.
