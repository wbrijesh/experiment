OpenBSD offers the best computing experience, hands down. If your
hardware supports it, it runs brilliantly. My
[laptop](/wiki/tools/laptop) does, and everything works perfectly
out-of-the-box.

The [man pages](https://man.openbsd.org) are excellent, config files are
beautifully simple, and the source is _clean_. Straight up great
engineering, by a group of people that actually dogfood the OS.
