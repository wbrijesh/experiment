The OnePlus 6T has been my (smart)phone since 2018. It sports a 6.4"
screen AMOLED screen, a Snapdragon 845 SoC, 8 gigs of RAM and 128 gigs
of internal storage, and was one of the first phones to implement an
on-screen finger print sensor.

I run [OmniROM](https://omnirom.org)'s Android 10 microG build, without
any Google Apps -- and have been comfortably doing so for about 3 years
now.

Some apps that I use:

- F-Droid -- free software app store
- Kuroba -- 4chan client
- Revolution IRC
- Lemudroid -- all-in-one retro-console emulator
- Password Store -- GPG-based password manager. Works with
  [pw](https://git.icyphox.sh/pw)
- NewPipe -- free software YouTube client
- Ultrasonic -- Subsonic client
- OpenKeychain -- GPG key management tool
