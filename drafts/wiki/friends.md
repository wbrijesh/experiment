### `#rice` @ rizon

`#rice` is a channel for discussing [ricing](/wiki/interests/ricing).
Off late, it has become generally off-topic due to the _commodification_
of ricing, as an art.

### `#homescreen` @ rizon

`#homescreen` is a relatively unmoderated free speech channel, initially
created to discuss ricing phone homescreens. It has long since been
off-topic, and remains one of the top channels in Rizon in terms of
activity. It's my favourite hangout, primarily for its chill userbase,
deeply rooted in [4chan](/wiki/culture/4chan) culture.
